## Introduction

Supafork is an open-source project that allows you to easily fork Supabase projects. Currently there are two ways to fork a Supabase project:

1. Using the Supabase CLI
2. Using the Supabase dashboard

Both of these methods have their own drawbacks. The Supabase CLI is mainly designed for developers and the Supabase dashboard requires you to manually copy and paste every single migration file. Supafork aims to solve these problems by providing a simple and easy-to-use interface for forking Supabase projects.

## Roadmap

Some more improvements that are planned in the future are:

- [ ] Improved migration error handling
- [ ] Supabase OAuth instead of database password
- [ ] Seeding support

Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request if you have any further ideas for improvements!
